Not a chance.
Uncertain, try again later.
As much as I want to say yes... No.
Absofrickinlutely.
Flip a coin instead.
HELL YES!
I don't think so.

Probably not.

My money is on yes.
Affirmative.
Negatory.
I'm afraid not.

Nopers :<
Yes (^-^)
No (>.<)
The answer lies within you.
Be wary of the pitfalls ahead; tread carefully.
A positive outcome awaits.
